# CS Central
This repository contains a **collection of projects** that were developed using **different programming languages**. The goal of this repository is to showcase the ***versatility*** of different programming languages and their capabilities in solving real-world problems.
Each project in this repository has its own directory, containing its source code and other necessary files. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including *machine learning, web development, android development*, and more. The following are some of the projects included in this repository:

-   A ***Python project*** that uses ***shanon's entropy*** to calculate the ***entropy of a text or url***
-   A ***Python project*** that generates a **word cloud**, a visual representation of text data in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.
-   A ***C++ project*** for generating simple result
- A ***PHP project*** for ***inventory managemant*** and ***GST invoice*** generation. 
- A ***Machine Learning project*** that uses ***YOLOv7s*** for ***realtime object detection***.  
- An ***Android Project:*** Tic-Tac-toe developed in ***Java & Android Studio*** 
- A ***Java Project*** for library management.
- ***And many more...***

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository provides a valuable resource for learning new programming languages and exploring their different use cases. Feel free to contribute to any of the projects or create your own project and add it to the repository.
