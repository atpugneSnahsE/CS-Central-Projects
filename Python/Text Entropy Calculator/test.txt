The history of Indian Aviation states back to 1912, December, when the first domestic flight flew
between Karachi and Delhi. It commenced when the Indian Air facilities collaborated with the
UK predicated imperial airways as an extension of London Karachi flight of the Imperial Airways.
Hence three years the provision commenced with the designation of Tata Sons Ltd, the first Indian
airline from Karachi and Madras. There was no backing from the Indian government [2].
In 1953, under the purview of the Indian Government Indian Airlines served the domestic civil
aviation. During independence time, 9 air convey companies carried air cargo and the passengers
within India. In 1948, the Indian regime and Air India together set up a company. Till the mid of
1990’s government possessed airlines controlled Indian aviation industry. In 1990, the government
of India implemented the open-sky policy and followed the liberalization rules. This paved the
road to expeditious transformation in aviation industry.
If we analyze the market size of the aviation industry in India, it is seen that the passenger traffic
rated at 341.05 million in fiscal year 2016. The compound yearly growth rate of 11.13 percent in
the course of 2016 to 2020. As per the report, the air traffic increased at a compound annual growth
rate of 5.32% from the fiscal year 2016 to 2020. It is assumed to reach to 7.27 % in 2023. The
aircraft movement increased in the rate of 9.83% in domestic aircraft and 3.57% in international
aircraft from FY16 to FY20.
Hence this development required a need of extra infrastructure, hence, in 2019, India had 103
operational airports. More airplanes operating in the sector is also a rising demand. With the
increase in the infrastructure, the investment also was demanded. So according to the statistics
produced by the Department for Promotion of the Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) [2],
Overseas Direct Investment grown up to US$2.75 billion amidst April 2000 and March 2000. The
regime has promoted 100% FDI under the automatic route in scheduled air travel facilities,
regional air travel service and national scheduled passenger airline. This venture is assumed to
reach 35,000 crores in the subsequent four years. So, it is planned by the government of India, to
invest US$ of 1.83 billion to develop the airport infrastructure along with the aviation navigation
services by 2026.The growth of the aviation Industry in India was tremendously in rise both economically and
socially. With the increase in the air flyers, the economic growth was also witnessed. Development
and investments in the industry was in increase, within these recent years. In 2019, AAI set up
plans to start the first three water airports in Andaman & Nicobar. It was additionally observed in
2020, January, just afore the outbreak of COVID-19, IndiGo was promulgated to be the first Indian
air carrier to increase the aircraft fleet size of 250 planes, which was venerated to operate 1500
flights per day. With the increase in the aircrafts, Indian Aviation industry had to invest US$ 150
million [23] for the aircraft maintenance, repair and Overhaul unit to render quality service to the
customers in December 2019. This service was completely exempted from the customs and
countervailing duties.
In November 2019 the Competition Commission of India permitted Adani Properties private
Limited to acquire the shareholding in Mumbai International Airport Limited. To cater to all these
requirements of the Aviation Industry, AAI has a long-term five-year plan, so to expand amenities
and infrastructure at the airports, it invested nearly 25,000 crores. To develop Guwahati as an interregional hub and Agartala, Imphal and Dibrugarh as intra-regional hubs it also undertook a strategy
to accomplish this. The services rendered by the aviation Industry was highly notes. In the year
2020, the air traffics was recorded to be 341.05 million [23] with the compound annual growth rate
of 11.13 percent. National passenger circulation also added to this development by having 274.50
million in FY20 with 66.54 million and the compound growth rate of 5.01 percent. The
international aircraft movement reached 2,155 thousand in FY20. So, to cater to these
developments, there were 103 operational airports in India, which increased 190–200 in FY20. It
was observed that It was also observed that air transport sector of India reached US$ 2.75 billion
in the middle of April 2000 and March 2020. The government has permitted 100 percent FDI under
the automatic route in planned air transport service, regional air transport facility and national
scheduled passenger airline. But, the government approval is required for FDI over 49 percent.
Aviation Industry of India is likely to witness Rs 35,000 crore (US$ 4.99 billion) investment in the
next four years. The aviation industry in India should witness a Rs 35,000 crores (US$4.99 billion)
investment over the next four years. For the expansion of airport infrastructure along with aviation
navigation services, India's Government is also planning to invest US$ 1.83 billion by 2026.
Accordingly, Indian Government has taken many Initiatives to further develop the aviation
industry. Under ‘Lifeline Udan’ an initiative by India's Government flights was operated for the
transportation of essential medical cargo to distant parts of the country to support India’s war
against COVID-19. As of May 05, 2020, Air India, Alliance Air, IAF including private carriers

5 
operated 465 flights. The government also introduced 'Krishi Udan Scheme' both on national and
international routes to aid farmers in transporting agricultural product and improving product
value. This scheme was introduced in Union Budget 2020–21. Government of India is also
promoting aircraft financing and leasing activities under the Union Budget 2019–20 to make
Indian aviation market self-reliant. T0 develop the new greenfield airport in Hirasar, Gujarat, the
Government of India In February 2019 sanctioned with an estimated investment of Rs 1,405 crore
(US$ 194.73 million). In January 2019, the Government of India was working on an overarching
plan to promote domestic aircraft manufacturing and financing in the country. In January 2019,
Government organized the Global Aviation Summit in Mumbai, which witnessed participation of
over 1,200 delegates from 83 countries. In January 2019, the Government of India released its
2019 National Air Cargo Policy Overview that envisioned making Indian air cargo and logistics
the most efficient, transparent and profitable across the globe by the end of the next decade.
The Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) is being rolled out. All these improvements made by
the Government brought in lot of economic development. Hence Under the RCS-Udan program,
about 34,74,000 passengers were carried and 335 routes were assigned in 2019, covering 33
airports (20 unserved, 3 underserved, 10 water aerodromes). In order to improve the promotion of
the environment a great deal of work has been done. As a result, as of October 2019, 55 IAA
airports have been reported as single-use plastic-free airport terminals. It was expected that India
would have the most aircraft flying on its regular airlines by December 2019. 
9. CONCLUSION :
(1) There are currently 91 international carriers in India, including 5 Indian carriers and 86 foreign
carriers, reflecting the development of the aviation industry in India. With this connection with
major countries of the world, the revenue passenger Kilometer in domestic airline demand growth
in 2018 was 18.6% [31] which is three time the global RPK growth of 6.5%.  
(2) IAA has 125 airports and runways out of a total of 464, and manages about 78% of domestic
passenger traffic and 22% of international passenger traffic. The cargo traffic share in promoting
economy was higher as 68.5% [32] in International cargo and 31.5% in domestic cargo traffic.
Together with this the maintenance, repair is expected to grow annually.
(3) Major achievement like the IGI airport in Delhi enhances safety and efficient in air transport
management service due to the advanced and highest air traffic control tower. Hence Indian
aviation sector is the highest contributor to Indian economy being the contribution of GDP of $72
[33].
(4) It contributes to the economy indirectly by promoting globalization, where the fliers increased
to 79 million in 2010 to 158 million in 2017. This may increase in the coming years. It also
supports 7.5 million employment and 6.2 million in tourism. The cargo market also shows largest
in UAE. Where, Delhi and Mumbai contribute highest to cargo market. Government is also aware
that the privatization will make the modification on structural change in service provided by the
airport and economically viable and sound [34].
(5) As it was noted that the customers always demand greater service from the airport and airlines
after spending money [35]. So, PP model is one of the best models to meet the needs of the
customer in systematic way. There are lot of challenges for the aviation industry. Presently the
pandemic faced globally will have a fall on the rise of the aviation industry. With the world bank
support the aviation should bring strategies to sustain its growth. However, the competitiveness of
the Travel and Tourism may pressurize the tourism infrastructure to bring in more strategy for
improvement.
