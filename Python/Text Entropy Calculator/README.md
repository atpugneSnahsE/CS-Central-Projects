# Text_entropy
This is a program to calculate entropy of a text.
Entropy of a text, In easy words can be drescribed as the amount of uncertainity in a text.
The higher the entropy the more uncertainity is in the text.
This code is dependent on Shannon's entropy, which is the most renowned mathmetical formula to calculate entropy.
